# BloomWebsite

This is Bloom, a full-stack website built around bringing together people with the same mission: participating in eco-activism initiatives and making our world a better place. 
Our website was first prototyped on Figma for Gator User Design's 2025 Design-a-thon, where we were awarded Runner Ups for Best Design for Gators.
We were so passionate about the project that we decided to take a step further and turn our prototype into an actual full-stack website. 
Our goal is to make it easier for anyone to discover environmental events, markets, and projects happening near them.

# Some highlighted features that we will be implementing:

📰 Eco News Feed – Curated articles from trusted sustainability sources, filterable by topic.

🗺️ Interactive Map – Find nearby eco-friendly events, farmers’ markets, cleanups, and drop-off sites.

🏠 Simple Home Page – Mission statement + quick access to news & map.

👥 About Page – Learn more about the Bloom team and our mission.

🌐 Responsive Design – Works on desktop and mobile.

♿ Accessibility First – Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard-friendly navigation.

We are also exploring possibilities to incorporate AI for eco-aware feedback, public forums for users to communicate, and a monthly highlighted featured city.


# The Tech Stack we are using is still being decided, but as of now:

Next.js - React framework with App Router.

Tailwind CSS - Utility-first styling.

React Leaflet - Interactive maps with OpenStreetMap tiles.

RSS Parser - Fetching and normalizing eco news feeds

Vercel - Hosting and automatic deployments.

# Thank you!

We hope you follow along with our progress and check out Bloom once it's completed!
