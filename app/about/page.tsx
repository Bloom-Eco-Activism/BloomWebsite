            <p>This is Bloom, a full-stack website built around bringing together people with the same mission:</p>
            <p>participating in eco-activism initiatives and making our world a better place. </p>
            <p>Our website was first prototyped on Figma for Gator User Design&apos;s 2025 Design-a-thon,</p>
            <p>where we were awarded Runner Ups for Best Design for Gators. </p>
            <p>We were so passionate about the project that we decided to take a step further </p>
            <p>and turn our prototype into an actual full-stack website. Our goal is to make it easier for </p>
            <p>anyone to discover environmental events, markets, and projects happening near them.</p>
